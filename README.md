## Overview of Election Audit
The project involved assisting a Colorado Board of Elections employee, Tom, in an election audit of the tabulated results for United States of America precinct in Colorado. The first phase of the project involved determining the total number of votes cast, the total number of votes for each candidate, the percentage of votes each candidate received and the winner of the election based on popular votes.  I used python to execute the task since Tomâ€™s manager wanted a way to automate this process to allow the code to use to audit other election results. 
The second phase of the project involved further auditing where the election commission required:
The voter turnout for each county
The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
The county with the highest turnout
I used for loops and conditional statements with membership and logical operators to find the requested results.

   ###Summary of Election Results


## Election-Audit Summary
Using python for this audit allowed me to perform complex calculations quickly and handle large data files. With modification, the script can be used to audit any election and also certify the results by finding the final election results of any election. 

Having successfully conducted this task, the script can be modified and used to audit other congressional districts, senatorial districts and local elections.  It can be modified by declaring winner of a state election. It can also be modified to find the results for  a particular county election.
